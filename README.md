# TimeClock
## A CLI to keep track of your personal and professional projects

## Dependencies
As long as you are using python 3 (I use 3.6.3), It should work.
If it doesn't, report a bug!

## Installation
After cloning and creating your own local repository, just run
timeClock.py.

## Use
After running timeClock.py, you will be promted by the CLI to
either run a command, or type HELP for more info.

Until you get used to the CLI, I'd recommend typing HELP as it
lists out all of the possible commands.

### START
To start a new project to track, type START.
You will then be prompted to enter a project name.
After that, TimeClock will start tracking your project.
This is when you would be working on your project.

### STOP
After you are done working on your project, type STOP- TimeClock
will now stop tracking your project. Don't forget to stop your projects
as TimeClock won't have a reference point for the end of your work session
and thus won't be able to calculate the amount of time you've spent on your
project!

### QUIT
When you're all done tracking your projects and what not, just type QUIT
or you can close out of the command prompt.
